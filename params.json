And then, it will fill this grid with tiles of different size.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\nCompiled and production-ready code can be found in the `dist` directory. The `src` directory contains development code.\r\n\r\n1. Include Moza on your site.\r\n```\r\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"./dist/css/master.css\">\r\n<script src=\"dist/js/moza.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Add the markup to your HTML.\r\n```\r\n<div id=\"myStage\" class=\"moza\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Initialize Moza.\r\n```\r\n<script>\r\n  var moza = new Moza();\r\n  moza.build({el: 'myStage', col:7, row:7});\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n> They don't know it yet but special thanks to: [@masyl](https://github.com/masyl),\r\n[@thoughtram](https://github.com/thoughtram/es6-browserify-boilerplate) &\r\n[@cferdinandi](https://github.com/cferdinandi)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
